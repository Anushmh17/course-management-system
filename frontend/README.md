# Course Management System — Frontend

React + Vite frontend for the Course Management System backend.

## 1. Start the backend first

The frontend talks to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

```cmd
cd ..\backend
node server.js
```

You should see:

```
Server running on port 3000
MySQL database connected
```

## 2. Start the frontend

```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite opens on **http://localhost:5173**.

## 3. Demo accounts

All seeded users use the same password.

| Username | Password   | Role    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| admin    | `admin123` | admin   |
| kamal    | `admin123` | student |
| nimal    | `admin123` | student |
| saman    | `admin123` | student |

## 6. How authentication works

1. `POST /api/auth/login` returns `{ message, token, user }`.
2. `auth.js` saves both in `localStorage`.
3. `api.js` has a **request interceptor** that adds
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every request automatically.
4. `ProtectedRoute.jsx` blocks pages the user is not allowed to see.
5. `Navbar.jsx` shows different links for guests, students and admins.
6. `Logout` clears both values with `clearAuth()`.

> The frontend guard is only for user experience. The backend verifies the
> JWT and the role again on every protected request.
